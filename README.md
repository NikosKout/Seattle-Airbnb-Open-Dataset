# Seattle-Airbnb-Open-Dataset
The purpose of this deliverable is to analyze the Seattle Airbnb Open Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) based on the CRISP-DM process.

The CRISP-DM methodology contains the following steps:
1) Business Understanding
2) Data Understanding
3) Prepare Data
4) Data Modeling
5) Evaluation

This analysis will help us answer the following three questions:

1) What is the most popular month to rent in Seattle?
2) How are the prices varying across all neighbourhoods in Seattle?
3) How is price affected by the features of the dataset?

The models used for this project to help us determine the features of listings.csv and calendar.csv, are Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression.
Random Forest Regression outperforms both models with a slight difference in comparison to the XGBoost.

# Libraries Used
